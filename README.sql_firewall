sql_firewall
============

Overview
--------

sql_firewall is a PostgreSQL extension which is intended to protect
database from SQL injections or unexpected queries.

sql_firewall module learns queries which can be executed, and
prevents/warns on executing queries which are not found in the learned
firewall rule.

How it works
------------

sql_firewall can take one of four modes specified in
sql_firewall.firewall parameter: "learning", "enforcing",
"permissive" and "disabled".

In the "learning" mode, sql_firewall collects pairs of "userid" and
"queryid" associated with the executed queries. "queryid" is
calculated based on a parse tree, similar to pg_stat_statements.

In the "enforcing" mode, sql_firewall checks whether queries are in
the list of collected pairs of "userid" and "queryid", the firewall
rules. When a query not in the firewall rules comes in, sql_firewall
produces an error with the message to prevent execution.

In the "permissive" mode, sql_firewall checks queries as well, but
allows to execute even not in the firewall rules. And produces
warnings if the queries are not in the rules.


Compatibility
-------------

sql_firewall supports PostgreSQL 9.4.x. Other major versions would be
supported in the future release.

verified postgresql versions
  - 9.4.26

Exported rule files would not be compatible between different
PostgreSQL major versions, because queryid is calculated from the
internal data structure (the Query structure) which is different in
different major versions.


Installation
------------

sql_firewall can be built as a PostgreSQL extension.

    $ export PATH=$PGHOME/bin:$PATH
    $ export USE_PGXS=1
    $ make
    $ sudo make install


Configuration
-------------

     $ vi $PGDATA/postgresql.conf
     <add>
     shared_preload_libraries = 'sql_firewall'
     sql_firewall.firewall = 'learning'
     </add>
     $ pg_ctl -D $PGDATA restart
     $ psql mydb
     mydb=# create extension sql_firewall;

sql_firewall would check all queries incoming to not only the specific
database where the module is installed, but all the databases in the
entire PostgreSQL cluster.

Even though, the views and functions in the module would be available
only on the installed database.


GUC Parameters
--------------

* shared_preload_libraries

  sql_firewall module needs to be loaded in the
  shared_preload_libraries parameter as following:

     shared_preload_libraries = 'sql_firewall'

   Note for developers
   -------------------

   pg_stat_statements built with `--enable-cassert' causes assert when
   queryId already has non-zero value.

   So, to use both pg_stat_statements and sql_firewall at the same
   time, pg_stat_statements needs to be loaded prior to sql_firewall
   in the shared_preload_libraries parameter as following.

     shared_preload_libraries = 'pg_stat_statements,sql_firewall'

   Then, sql_firewall can skip queryId calculation if queryId is
   already set by pg_stat_statements, and avoid the assert.

* sql_firewall.firewall

  sql_firewall.firewall is able to take one of the following values:
  'disabled', 'learning', 'permissive' and 'enforcing'.
  The default value is 'disabled'.

* sql_firewall.max

  Number of queries the SQL Firewall can learn.
  It can take an int value between 100 and INT_MAX.
  The default value is 5000.
  The queries which exceed this value in the "learning" mode would never
  be learned.

* sql_firewall.engine

  rule engine work state, can be one of whitelist, blacklist or hybrid.

Functions
---------

* sql_firewall_reset()

  sql_firewall_reset() clears the firewall rules.

  This function is available only under the disabled mode with
  superuser privilege.

* sql_firewall_stat_reset()

  sql_firewall_reset() clears the counters of warning and error. Only
  available with superuser privilege.

* sql_firewall_export_rule('/path/to/rule.txt')

  sql_firewall_export_rule() writes the firewall rules in the
  specified CSV file.

  This function is available only under the disabled mode with
  superuser privilege.

* sql_firewall_import_rule('/path/to/rule.txt')

  sql_firewall_import_rule() reads the firewall rules from the
  specified CSV file.

  This function is available only under the disabled mode with
  superuser privilege.

* sql_firewall.add_rule(user text, query text, type)

  user, the name of user this rule should be applied to. if no user
  name is specified, this rule would applied to all users.
  query, the query text that not has been normalized with constant
  parameters
  type, can be one of 'whitelist' or 'blacklist

* sql_firewall.del_rule(user text, query text, type)

  same as sql_firewall.add_rule


Views
-----

* sql_firewall.sql_firewall_statements

  sql_firewall_statements view shows the firewall rules and execution
  counter for each query.

    postgres=# select * from sql_firewall.sql_firewall_statements;
     userid |  queryid   |              query              | calls
    --------+------------+---------------------------------+-------
         10 | 3294787656 | select * from k1 where uid = ?; |     4
    (1 row)
    
    postgres=#

* sql_firewall.sql_firewall_stat

  sql_firewall_stat view has two counters: "sql_warning" and
  "sql_error".

  "sql_warning" shows number of executed queries with warnings in the
  "permissive" mode.

  "sql_error" shows number of prevented queries in the "enforcing"
  mode.

    postgres=# select * from sql_firewall.sql_firewall_stat;
     sql_warning | sql_error
    -------------+-----------
               2 |         1
    (1 row)
    
    postgres=# 

* sql_firewall.all_rules

  show both whitelist and blacklist rules

* sql_firewall.whitelist

  show whitelist rules

* sql_firewall.blacklist

  show blacklist rules

Examples
--------

* Permissive mode

    postgres=# select * from sql_firewall.sql_firewall_statements;
    WARNING:  Prohibited SQL statement
     userid |  queryid   |              query              | calls
